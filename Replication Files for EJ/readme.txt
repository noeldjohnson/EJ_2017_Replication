This is the readme file for replicating the data analysis for Jewish Persecutions and Weather Shocks, 1100-1800.  There are four folders corresponding to the four data sets analyzed.  The sources for these data sets are described in detail in the text and data appendix to the published paper.  The four data sets are: the 5-year data set (Tables 1, 2, 7, 10, 11 and Figures 4, 6, 7), the one-year data set (Tables 3, 4, 5, 8 and Figure 3), the rainfall data set (Tables 12 and 13), and the wheat prices data set (Tables 6 and 9).  The code to generate each table and figure is labeled in each of the .do files.  The variables in each of the .dta files are also clearly labeled. There is also included a file called "Country Codes" which describes the country codes (which are identical) in all four data sets.
